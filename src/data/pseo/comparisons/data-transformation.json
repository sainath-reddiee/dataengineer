    "intro": "### The SQL Framework Wars\n\nBefore **dbt (data build tool)**, data transformation was often a mess of stored procedures and unversioned SQL scripts. dbt changed the world by bringing software engineering best practices—version control, testing, documentation, and CI/CD—to SQL.\n\n**Dataform** was a direct competitor that offered similar functionality with a slightly different flavor (JavaScript for config instead of YAML). Google acquired Dataform in 2020 and has integrated it directly into BigQuery as a native, free service.\n\n### The Core Difference\n\nThe biggest differentiator is **portability**. dbt can run on Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks, Postgres, and more. Learning dbt is a transferable skill. Dataform is now effectively a Google Cloud product. It is optimized specifically for BigQuery and runs entirely within that ecosystem.",

    "intro": "### The Transformation Layer: Standard vs. Next-Gen\n\nBoth tools transform raw data into analytics-ready models using SQL, but they take very different technical approaches.\n\n**dbt (data build tool)** is the undisputed king of SQL transformation. With 40,000+ companies using it, dbt Core (open-source) and dbt Cloud provide a proven framework for building, testing, and documenting data models. Its strength is simplicity — write SELECT statements, define dependencies, and dbt compiles and runs them in the correct order.\n\n**SQLMesh** is a next-generation framework built by former data leaders at Airbnb and Netflix. It addresses dbt's biggest pain points: slow development cycles, wasteful warehouse compute during testing, and lack of column-level lineage. SQLMesh introduces **Virtual Environments** (preview changes without running queries), **automatic incremental models**, and **plan-based deployment** (like a `git diff` for your data warehouse).\n\n**The core tension:** dbt has the ecosystem; SQLMesh has the technology.",
