    "fullDefinition": "Microsoft Purview is a fundamental concept in data engineering that plays a crucial role in modern data infrastructure.\n\n## What is Microsoft Purview?\n\nA comprehensive family of data governance, risk, and compliance solutions.\n\n## Why Microsoft Purview Matters\n\nUnderstanding Microsoft Purview is essential for data engineers because:\n\n### Business Impact\n- Enables data-driven decision making\n- Improves operational efficiency\n- Reduces costs and time-to-insight\n- Supports compliance and governance\n\n### Technical Benefits\n- Scalable data processing\n- Improved reliability and performance\n- Better data quality and consistency\n- Enhanced integration capabilities\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Architecture\nMicrosoft Purview typically involves these architectural considerations:\n\n1. **Data Sources**: Where data originates (databases, APIs, files, streams)\n2. **Processing**: How data is transformed and enriched\n3. **Storage**: Where processed data is persisted\n4. **Access**: How users and applications consume data\n\n### Key Components\nModern implementations include:\n\n- Ingestion pipelines for data collection\n- Processing engines for transformation\n- Storage systems for persistence\n- Query interfaces for access\n- Monitoring tools for observability\n\n## Implementation Best Practices\n\n### Design Principles\n- Design for scalability from the start\n- Implement idempotent operations\n- Use declarative configurations\n- Embrace automation\n\n### Reliability\n- Build in redundancy and failover\n- Implement comprehensive monitoring\n- Create runbooks for common issues\n- Test disaster recovery procedures\n\n### Performance\n- Optimize for common access patterns\n- Use appropriate caching strategies\n- Parallelize where possible\n- Monitor and tune regularly\n\n### Security\n- Follow least-privilege principle\n- Encrypt sensitive data\n- Audit all access and changes\n- Regular security reviews\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Batch Processing\nProcess large volumes of data on a schedule, typically for historical analysis and reporting.\n\n### Stream Processing\nHandle data in real-time as it arrives, enabling immediate insights and actions.\n\n### Hybrid Approach\nCombine batch and stream processing using the Lambda or Kappa architecture patterns.\n\n## Integration with Modern Data Stack\n\nMicrosoft Purview integrates with:\n- Data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)\n- Data lakes (Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg)\n- Orchestration (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster)\n- BI tools (Tableau, Looker, Power BI)\n- ML platforms (MLflow, Kubeflow, SageMaker)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo implement Microsoft Purview effectively:\n\n1. **Assess Requirements**: Understand data volumes, latency needs, and use cases\n2. **Choose Tools**: Select appropriate technologies for your stack\n3. **Design Architecture**: Plan for scalability and reliability\n4. **Implement Gradually**: Start simple and iterate\n5. **Monitor and Improve**: Track performance and optimize",
