        "intro": "### The Foundation of the Lakehouse\n\nTo build a Data Lakehouse, you need a **Table Format** to manage files in S3. **Apache Iceberg** and **Apache Hudi** (Hadoop Upserts Deletes and Incrementals) are the two battle-hardened open standards.\n\n**Apache Iceberg** (from Netflix) was built for massive datasets and engine neutrality. It focuses on correctness and preventing the problems of Hive (like slow metadata listing). It's winning the adoption war with support from Snowflake and AWS.\n\n**Apache Hudi** (from Uber) was built for a specific, difficult problem: high-volume incremental updates (upserts). It offers unique features like 'Merge on Read' (MoR) and 'Copy on Write' (CoW) to balance write and read performance for streaming data.",
