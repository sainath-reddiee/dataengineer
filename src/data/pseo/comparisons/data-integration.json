    "shortVerdict": "Fivetran is the \"Apple\" of ELT—expensive but it just works. Airbyte is the \"Android/Linux\"—open, flexible, and ubiquitous.",
    "intro": "### The Data Movement Dilemma\n\nEvery data platform needs data moved into it. **Fivetran** pioneered the \"Managed ELT\" market. Their value prop is simple: You pay us, and we guarantee your Salesforce data lands in Snowflake every 15 minutes. No coding, no maintenance.\n\n**Airbyte** entered as the open-source disruptor. They correctly identified that Fivetran was too expensive for many, and that the \"Long Tail\" of connectors (custom APIs) wasn't being served. Airbyte provides a platform where *anyone* can build a connector.\n\n### The Trade-off\n\nFivetran is a black box. You trust them to handle schema drift and API changes. It is extremely reliable but costs a premium (based on Monthly Active Rows).\nAirbyte puts the power in your hands. You can self-host it for \"free\" (compute costs only), or use their Cloud. The connector quality varies (Gold vs. Alpha), but the flexibility is infinite.",
