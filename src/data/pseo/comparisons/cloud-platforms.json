    "intro": "### Defining Modern Data Infrastructure\n\nData Engineers have to manage more than just code; they manage S3 buckets, Snowflake Warehouses, and VPCs. This is **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.\n\n**Terraform** (HashiCorp) is the king of the mountain. It uses a custom language called **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)** which is declarative and easy for Ops teams to read. It has the largest ecosystem of providers in the world.\n\n**Pulumi** challenged the status quo by allowing you to define infrastructure using **standard programming languages** like Python, TypeScript, Go, and C#. This enables much more complex logic (loops, conditionals) and better testing while leveraging the same underlying provider logic as Terraform.",

    "intro": "### The Lakehouse Platform vs. The Serverless Warehouse\n\n**Databricks** is a unified data analytics platform built around Apache Spark. It combines a data lakehouse architecture (Delta Lake), collaborative notebooks, MLflow for ML lifecycle, and Unity Catalog for governance. Databricks excels at **complex engineering workloads** — ETL pipelines, ML training, streaming, and large-scale data processing.\n\n**Google BigQuery** is a fully serverless, petabyte-scale data warehouse. There's nothing to provision, no clusters to manage, and no indexes to create. Load your data, write SQL, and BigQuery handles the rest. It's the simplest path from raw data to business insights.\n\n**The core trade-off:** Databricks gives you a complete data platform with maximum flexibility. BigQuery gives you the fastest path to analytics with minimum operational burden.",
