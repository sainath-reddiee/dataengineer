    "shortVerdict": "Choose Airflow for enterprise-scale, static dependencies. Choose Prefect for modern, dynamic workflows and easier developer experience.",
    "intro": "Apache Airflow has been the industry standard for code-based data orchestration for years. However, Prefect has emerged as a strong \"modern\" contender, fixing many of Airflow's pain points like scheduling latency and complex deployment.\n\nThis comparison breaks down the key differences to help you decide which orchestrator fits your data stack.",
