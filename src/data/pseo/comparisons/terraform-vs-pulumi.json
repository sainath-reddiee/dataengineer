        "shortVerdict": "Terraform is the YAML/HCL standard for infrastructure. Pulumi is the 'Infrastructure as Code' tool that lets you use real programming languages (Python, Go, JS).",
        "intro": "### Defining Modern Data Infrastructure\n\nData Engineers have to manage more than just code; they manage S3 buckets, Snowflake Warehouses, and VPCs. This is **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.\n\n**Terraform** (HashiCorp) is the king of the mountain. It uses a custom language called **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)** which is declarative and easy for Ops teams to read. It has the largest ecosystem of providers in the world.\n\n**Pulumi** challenged the status quo by allowing you to define infrastructure using **standard programming languages** like Python, TypeScript, Go, and C#. This enables much more complex logic (loops, conditionals) and better testing while leveraging the same underlying provider logic as Terraform.",
