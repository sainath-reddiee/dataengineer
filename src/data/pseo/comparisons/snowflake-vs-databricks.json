        "intro": "### The Battle for the Modern Data Stack\n\nFor years, **Snowflake** and **Databricks** were complementary tools: Snowflake for the warehouse, Databricks for the data science. Today, they are in a head-to-head war. Snowflake is expanding into data engineering with **Snowpark**, while Databricks is aggressively pursuing the data warehouse market with **Databricks SQL** and its **Serverless** offerings.\n\n**Snowflake** began as a cloud-native data warehouse. Its brilliance lies in its simplicity—everything is SQL, and there are virtually no knobs to turn. It pioneered the separation of storage and compute.\n\n**Databricks** was founded by the creators of Apache Spark. It pioneered the **Data Lakehouse** architecture—the idea that you can get data warehouse performance directly on top of your low-cost data lake (S3/ADLS/GCS) using open formats like Delta Lake.",
