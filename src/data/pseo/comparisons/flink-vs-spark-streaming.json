        "shortVerdict": "Flink is for true 'sub-second' streaming with complex state. Spark (Structured Streaming) is the choice for unified batch/stream processing with existing Spark talent.",
        "intro": "### The Streaming Purity Test\n\nIn the world of real-time data, there is a fundamental split: **Native Streaming** vs. **Micro-batching**.\n\n**Apache Flink** is a native streaming engine. It processes every single event as it arrives. This allows for ultra-low latency (milliseconds) and sophisticated \"stateful\" processing (e.g., tracking a user's session over hours in real-time).\n\n**Apache Spark (Structured Streaming)** uses a micro-batch model. It collects data for a few seconds and then processes it like a tiny batch job. While this is slightly slower (latencies of 1s+), it benefits from the massive Spark ecosystem and a unified API that works for both batch and streaming.",
