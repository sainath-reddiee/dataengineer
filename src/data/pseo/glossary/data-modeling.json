It defines entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints—serving as the blueprint for databases and data warehouses.\n\n## Types of Data Models\n\n### 1. Conceptual Model\nHigh-level business view:\n- Entities and relationships\n- No technical details\n- Understood by business stakeholders\n\n### 2. Logical Model\nDetailed structure without platform specifics:\n- Attributes and data types\n- Primary and foreign keys\n- Normalization rules\n\n### 3. Physical Model\nImplementation-ready design:\n- Table definitions with exact data types\n- Indexes and partitions\n- Platform-specific optimizations\n\n## Data Modeling Techniques\n\n### Dimensional Modeling (Kimball)\nOptimized for analytics and BI:\n- **Fact Tables**: Metrics and measurements\n- **Dimension Tables**: Descriptive attributes\n- **Star Schema**: Fact table surrounded by dimensions\n- **Snowflake Schema**: Normalized dimensions\n\n### Data Vault\nScalable, auditable modeling:\n- **Hubs**: Business keys\n- **Links**: Relationships\n- **Satellites**: Descriptive data with history\n\n### One Big Table (OBT)\nModern, denormalized approach:\n- Single wide table with all data\n- Optimized for cloud warehouses\n- Simple, fast queries\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Start with Business Questions**: Model for how data will be used\n2. **Document Everything**: Maintain a data dictionary\n3. **Think About Change**: Design for schema evolution\n4. **Test with Real Queries**: Validate performance early\n5. **Use dbt for Implementation**: Transform raw to modeled data\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- Over-normalization for analytical workloads\n- Ignoring query performance during design\n- Not involving business stakeholders\n- Skipping documentation",
