        "intro": "### Open Source Data Integration\n\nMoving data from API A to Database B is the most repetitive task in data engineering. **Airbyte** and **Meltano** are the two leaders trying to break the monopoly of closed-source giants like Fivetran.\n\n**Airbyte** focuses on a massive connector catalog and an easy-to-use UI. It handles the scheduling and orchestration within its own platform (Docker/Kubernetes). It wants to be the \"standard\" connector layer for everyone.\n\n**Meltano** (originally from GitLab) takes a purely \"DataOps\" approach. It treats ELT pipelines as code. Everything is managed via a YAML file and the CLI. It uses the **Singer** SDK standard but wraps it in a modern development workflow.",
