      {
        "question": "What is Databricks used for?",
        "answer": "Databricks is used for unified data analytics—combining data engineering, data science, and machine learning on one platform. It is particularly strong for large-scale data processing, ML workflows, and lakehouse architecture."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Databricks a data warehouse?",
        "answer": "Databricks is a data lakehouse, not a traditional data warehouse. It combines data lake flexibility with warehouse features like ACID transactions and fast SQL queries, enabled by Delta Lake."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Databricks the same as Spark?",
        "answer": "Databricks is built on Apache Spark but adds a managed cloud platform, collaboration features, Delta Lake, MLflow, and Unity Catalog. Think of it as \"Spark++\" with enterprise features."
      },
      {
        "question": "Databricks vs Snowflake: which is better?",
        "answer": "Snowflake excels at SQL analytics and is simpler to use. Databricks is better for data science, ML, and when you need open formats and advanced Spark capabilities. Many organizations use both."
