    "fullDefinition": "Snowflake is a cloud-native data warehouse platform built for the modern data stack. Unlike traditional data warehouses, Snowflake was designed from the ground up for the cloud, offering unique architecture that separates storage and compute resources.\n\n## Key Architecture Features\n\nSnowflake uses a **multi-cluster shared data architecture** that consists of three layers:\n\n1. **Database Storage Layer**: Data is stored in a compressed, columnar format in cloud object storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage). This layer is fully managed and automatically optimized.\n\n2. **Query Processing Layer (Virtual Warehouses)**: Compute clusters that execute queries independent of storage. You can spin up multiple warehouses of different sizes without affecting each other.\n\n3. **Cloud Services Layer**: Handles authentication, infrastructure management, metadata, query optimization, and access control.\n\n## Why Data Engineers Choose Snowflake\n\n- **Zero Management**: No indexes to tune, no partitions to manage\n- **Instant Elasticity**: Scale compute up/down in seconds\n- **Concurrency**: Multiple workloads without resource contention\n- **Time Travel**: Query historical data up to 90 days back\n- **Data Sharing**: Share live data across organizations securely\n- **Semi-structured Data**: Native support for JSON, Avro, Parquet\n\n## Snowflake vs Traditional Data Warehouses\n\nTraditional on-premise solutions like Teradata or Oracle require significant hardware investment and maintenance. Snowflake eliminates this with its SaaS model, offering true pay-per-second pricing and automatic performance optimization.\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n- **Data Lakes**: Combine structured and semi-structured data\n- **Data Engineering**: Build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines\n- **Data Science**: Run ML workloads with Snowpark\n- **Business Intelligence**: Power dashboards with fast queries",

      },
      {
        "question": "How does Snowflake pricing work?",
        "answer": "Snowflake uses a consumption-based pricing model. You pay separately for storage (per TB/month) and compute (per credit consumed). Compute is charged per-second with a 60-second minimum, so you only pay when queries are running."

    "fullDefinition": "**Apache Iceberg** is an open table format designed for petabyte-scale analytic datasets. Created at Netflix, it solves the fundamental problems that made data lakes unreliable — by bringing **ACID transactions**, **time travel**, **schema evolution**, and **partition evolution** to files sitting in object storage (S3, GCS, ADLS).\n\n## The Problem Iceberg Solves\n\nTraditional data lakes stored data as raw files (Parquet/ORC) with a Hive Metastore tracking partitions. This architecture had critical flaws:\n\n- **No ACID**: Concurrent writes could corrupt data\n- **Partition Lock-in**: Changing partition schemes required rewriting all data\n- **No Time Travel**: Can't query historical states\n- **Schema Rigidity**: Adding columns was painful\n- **Small File Problem**: Too many small files destroyed performance\n\nIceberg fixes ALL of these.\n\n## How Iceberg Works\n\n```\nQuery Engine (Spark/Trino/Flink)\n        │\n        ▼\n┌─────────────────┐\n│  Iceberg Catalog │ (Where is the latest table state?)\n│  (REST/Glue/Nessie)│\n└────────┬────────┘\n         │\n┌────────▼────────┐\n│ Metadata Layer  │ (Manifest files + Manifest Lists)\n│  - Snapshots    │\n│  - Manifests    │\n│  - Statistics   │\n└────────┬────────┘\n         │\n┌────────▼────────┐\n│  Data Files     │ (Parquet/ORC/Avro in S3/GCS/ADLS)\n└─────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Key Features\n\n### ACID Transactions\n- Atomic commits: writes either fully succeed or fully fail\n- Snapshot isolation for concurrent reads and writes\n- No more corrupted tables from failed jobs\n\n### Time Travel\n```sql\n-- Query data as it was 24 hours ago\nSELECT * FROM orders\nFOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2026-02-26 09:00:00';\n\n-- Roll back to a previous snapshot\nALTER TABLE orders ROLLBACK TO SNAPSHOT 12345;\n```\n\n### Schema Evolution\n- Add, drop, rename, or reorder columns without rewriting data\n- Type promotion (int → long, float → double) is safe\n- No downtime for schema changes\n\n### Partition Evolution\n- Change partition schemes without rewriting data\n- Start with daily partitions, switch to hourly — Iceberg handles it\n- Hidden partitioning: users don't need to know partition columns\n\n### Engine Compatibility\nIceberg tables can be read/written by multiple engines simultaneously:\n- Apache Spark, Trino/Presto, Flink, Snowflake, BigQuery, Dremio, StarRocks\n\n## Iceberg vs Delta Lake vs Hudi\n\n| Feature | Iceberg | Delta Lake | Hudi |\n|---------|---------|------------|------|\n| Governance | Apache Foundation | Databricks | Apache Foundation |\n| Engine Lock-in | None | Spark-first | Spark-first |\n| Partition Evolution | ✅ Best-in-class | ❌ | Partial |\n| Catalog Options | REST, Glue, Nessie, Polaris | Unity Catalog | Hive Metastore |\n| Adoption Trend | 📈 Fastest growing | 📈 Strong (Databricks) | ➡️ Stable |",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is Apache Iceberg used for?",
        "answer": "Apache Iceberg is used to manage large analytical datasets in data lakes. It provides warehouse-like features (ACID transactions, time travel, schema evolution) to files stored in S3, GCS, or ADLS."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Apache Iceberg better than Delta Lake?",
        "answer": "Iceberg is more engine-agnostic and has superior partition evolution. Delta Lake is tightly integrated with Databricks and Spark. The best choice depends on your stack — Iceberg for multi-engine environments, Delta for Databricks shops."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Snowflake support Apache Iceberg?",
        "answer": "Yes. Snowflake supports Iceberg Tables natively, allowing you to query and manage Iceberg-formatted data in S3/GCS/ADLS directly from Snowflake. This is a core part of Snowflake's open data strategy."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between Iceberg and Parquet?",
        "answer": "Parquet is a file format (how data is stored). Iceberg is a table format (how files are organized and managed). Iceberg typically uses Parquet files underneath but adds metadata, transactions, and versioning on top."
