    "intro": "### The Cloud Data Warehouse Battle\n\nSnowflake and Google BigQuery are arguably the two most important data platforms of the last decade. They both solved the core problem of \"Big Data\": decoupling storage from compute to allow infinite scaling. However, they approached it from different angles.\n\n**Snowflake** built a product that could run on ANY cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), effectively becoming the \"Switzerland\" of data. It focuses heavily on \"Data Sharing\" and ease of use.\n**BigQuery** was Google opening up its internal Dremel technology to the world. It is a true serverless powerhouse that can chew through petabytes of data in seconds with zero configuration.\n\n### Architecture Comparison\n\n*   **Snowflake:** Uses a virtual warehouse model. You spin up \"Introduction\" or \"X-Large\" warehouses. They run for a specific time, and you pay for the seconds they are active. Storage is separate.\n*   **BigQuery:** Truly serverless. There are no \"nodes\" or \"clusters\" to manage. You submit a query, and Google allocates thousands of slots (workers) to execute it. You pay for the bytes scanned (in the on-demand model) or buy slots (in the edition model).",

Iceberg was slower but truly community-driven. Today, both are fully open source, and feature parity is close. The choice is largely political and ecosystem-driven.",
