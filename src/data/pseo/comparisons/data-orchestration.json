    "shortVerdict": "Airflow is the task-based standard. Dagster is the asset-based challenger that brings data awareness to the orchestration layer.",
    "intro": "### Task vs. Asset Orchestration\n\n**Apache Airflow** views the world as a series of **tasks** to be executed. \"Run Task A, then Run Task B.\" It doesn't really know *what* Task A produced, only that it succeeded or failed.\n\n**Dagster** flips this model on its head. It views the world as a set of **Software-Defined Assets** (SDAs). \"I need the 'Daily Sales Table'. To get that, I need to run this upstream logic.\" Dagster implies the graph from the data dependencies, whereas Airflow defines the graph explicitly.\n\nThis \"Asset-Centric\" approach makes Dagster uniquely powerful for data engineering, as it integrates the *definition* of the data with the *execution* of the logic.",
