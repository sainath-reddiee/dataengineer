    "intro": "### The Orchestration Heavyweights\n\nIn the world of data engineering, **Apache Airflow** and **Prefect** represent two generations of workflow orchestration. Airflow, born at Airbnb in 2014, established the concept of \"configuration as code\" and became the industry standard. Prefect, launched later by an Airflow maintainer, was designed specifically to address Airflow's major pain points—specifically around dynamic workflows, testing, and the \"scheduler loop\" latency.\n\n### Key Differences at a Glance\n\n*   **Architecture:** Airflow uses a rigid scheduler loop and a database of metadata. Prefect uses a hybrid model where code runs in your environment but orchestrates headers to a central API (Cloud or Server).\n*   **Philosophy:** Airflow thinks in \"Tasks\" and \"DAGs\" (static). Prefect thinks in \"Flows\" and \"Tasks\" that are just Python functions (dynamic).\n*   **Developer Experience:** Airflow requires learning its specific operators and DSL. Prefect feels much more like writing standard Python code with decorators.\n\n### Deep Dive: The \"Modern\" Data Stack\n\nAirflow is still the safe bet for large enterprises. Its community is massive, and you can find a provider/operator for almost any tool in existence. However, maintaining a production Airflow instance (even managed ones like MWAA or Cloud Composer) can be operationally heavy.\n\nPrefect shines in \"negative engineering\"—handling the failure logic so you don't have to. Its \"Hybrid Execution\" model is also a game-changer for security-conscious teams, as your data never leaves your infrastructure, only the metadata of the run status goes to Prefect Cloud.",
