    "fullDefinition": "Apache Airflow is a fundamental concept in data engineering that plays a crucial role in modern data infrastructure.\n\n## What is Apache Airflow?\n\nAn open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows, commonly used for orchestrating data pipelines and ETL jobs.\n\n## Why Apache Airflow Matters\n\nUnderstanding Apache Airflow is essential for data engineers because:\n\n### Business Impact\n- Enables data-driven decision making\n- Improves operational efficiency\n- Reduces costs and time-to-insight\n- Supports compliance and governance\n\n### Technical Benefits\n- Scalable data processing\n- Improved reliability and performance\n- Better data quality and consistency\n- Enhanced integration capabilities\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### Architecture\nApache Airflow typically involves these architectural considerations:\n\n1. **Data Sources**: Where data originates (databases, APIs, files, streams)\n2. **Processing**: How data is transformed and enriched\n3. **Storage**: Where processed data is persisted\n4. **Access**: How users and applications consume data\n\n### Key Components\nModern implementations include:\n\n- Ingestion pipelines for data collection\n- Processing engines for transformation\n- Storage systems for persistence\n- Query interfaces for access\n- Monitoring tools for observability\n\n## Implementation Best Practices\n\n### Design Principles\n- Design for scalability from the start\n- Implement idempotent operations\n- Use declarative configurations\n- Embrace automation\n\n### Reliability\n- Build in redundancy and failover\n- Implement comprehensive monitoring\n- Create runbooks for common issues\n- Test disaster recovery procedures\n\n### Performance\n- Optimize for common access patterns\n- Use appropriate caching strategies\n- Parallelize where possible\n- Monitor and tune regularly\n\n### Security\n- Follow least-privilege principle\n- Encrypt sensitive data\n- Audit all access and changes\n- Regular security reviews\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Batch Processing\nProcess large volumes of data on a schedule, typically for historical analysis and reporting.\n\n### Stream Processing\nHandle data in real-time as it arrives, enabling immediate insights and actions.\n\n### Hybrid Approach\nCombine batch and stream processing using the Lambda or Kappa architecture patterns.\n\n## Integration with Modern Data Stack\n\nApache Airflow integrates with:\n- Data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)\n- Data lakes (Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg)\n- Orchestration (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster)\n- BI tools (Tableau, Looker, Power BI)\n- ML platforms (MLflow, Kubeflow, SageMaker)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo implement Apache Airflow effectively:\n\n1. **Assess Requirements**: Understand data volumes, latency needs, and use cases\n2. **Choose Tools**: Select appropriate technologies for your stack\n3. **Design Architecture**: Plan for scalability and reliability\n4. **Implement Gradually**: Start simple and iterate\n5. **Monitor and Improve**: Track performance and optimize",

      {
        "question": "What is Apache Airflow used for?",
        "answer": "Apache Airflow is used for orchestrating complex workflows, particularly data pipelines. It schedules tasks, manages dependencies, handles retries, and provides monitoring through a web interface."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Airflow an ETL tool?",
        "answer": "Airflow is an orchestration tool, not an ETL tool. It schedules and monitors ETL jobs but does not extract, transform, or load data itself. You use Airflow to coordinate tools like dbt, Python scripts, or SQL queries."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a DAG in Airflow?",
        "answer": "A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a collection of tasks with defined dependencies. It represents a complete workflow where each task runs after its upstream dependencies complete successfully."

      {
        "question": "Is Airflow free to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, Apache Airflow is 100% free and open-source. Managed versions like Astronomer, MWAA (AWS), and Cloud Composer (Google) offer paid hosting with additional features."
