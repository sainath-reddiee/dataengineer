        "intro": "### The Transformation Evolution\n\n**dbt (Data Build Tool)** revolutionized the data industry by bringing software engineering best practices—version control, testing, and documentation—to SQL. It turned analysts into \"Analytics Engineers.\"\n\n**SQLMesh** is a newer entrant that argues dbt’s \"text-based\" approach to SQL is limited. SQLMesh uses a **Semantic SQL** engine that actually understands the SQL grammar, enabling features like Virtual Environments, automatic column-level lineage, and faster incremental builds without the complexity of dbt’s Jinja templates.",
