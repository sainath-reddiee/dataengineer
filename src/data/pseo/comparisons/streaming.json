    "intro": "### The Streaming Standard vs. The Speed Demon\n\n**Apache Kafka** birthed the modern era of event streaming. It is robust, scalable, and used by virtually every tech giant. However, it is built on the JVM (Java) and notoriously requires **ZooKeeper** (though KRaft is changing this) to manage cluster state. This makes it heavy and complex to operate.\n\n**Redpanda** is a modern rewrite of the Kafka protocol in **C++**. It uses a thread-per-core architecture to squeeze maximum performance out of modern hardware. Crucially, it compiles to a **single binary** with zero external dependencies (no ZooKeeper!). It is \"Kafka API Compatible,\" meaning existing Kafka clients work with Redpanda out of the box.",
