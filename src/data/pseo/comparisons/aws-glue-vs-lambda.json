        "intro": "### Serverless Processing: Big vs. Small\n\nWhen building a data pipeline on AWS, the most common architectural question is: \"Do I use Glue or Lambda?\" Both are serverless, both scale automatically, and both allow you to run Python or Java code. However, the underlying infrastructure and use cases are vastly different.\n\n**AWS Glue** is a managed ETL service built on **Apache Spark**. It is designed to handle petabytes of data, managed through long-running \"jobs.\" It includes a Data Catalog, crawlers, and a visual development environment.\n\n**AWS Lambda** is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). It is designed to execute small pieces of code in response to events (e.g., a file arriving in S3). It has a strict **15-minute execution limit** and limited memory/CPU compared to Glue.",
