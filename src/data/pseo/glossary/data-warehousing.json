        "question": "Is Snowflake a database or data warehouse?",

        "question": "How does Snowflake pricing work?",
        "answer": "Snowflake uses a consumption-based pricing model. You pay separately for storage (per TB/month) and compute (per credit consumed). Compute is charged per-second with a 60-second minimum, so you only pay when queries are running."
