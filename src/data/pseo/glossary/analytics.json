    "fullDefinition": "Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine designed for large-scale data processing. It provides high-level APIs in Python, Scala, Java, and R, along with an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. Spark can run on clusters of thousands of machines.\n\n## Why Spark?\n\nSpark was created to address limitations of Hadoop MapReduce:\n- **Speed**: 100x faster than Hadoop for in-memory processing\n- **Ease of Use**: Rich APIs vs low-level MapReduce code\n- **Unified Platform**: Batch, streaming, ML, and graph in one engine\n- **Versatility**: Works with any data source and storage system\n\n## Core Components\n\n### 1. Spark Core\nThe foundation providing:\n- Distributed task dispatching and scheduling\n- Memory management\n- Fault recovery\n- I/O operations\n\n### 2. Spark SQL\nQuery structured data using SQL or DataFrames:\n```python\ndf = spark.read.parquet(\"s3://data/users\")\ndf.filter(df.age > 21).groupBy(\"city\").count().show()\n```\n\n### 3. Spark Streaming (Structured Streaming)\nProcess real-time data streams:\n```python\nstream_df = spark.readStream.format(\"kafka\").load()\nquery = stream_df.writeStream.format(\"console\").start()\n```\n\n### 4. MLlib\nMachine learning at scale:\n- Classification, regression, clustering\n- Feature engineering pipelines\n- Model persistence\n\n### 5. GraphX\nGraph computation for:\n- Social network analysis\n- Fraud detection\n- Recommendation engines\n\n## Spark Ecosystem\n\n- **PySpark**: Python API (most popular)\n- **Spark on Databricks**: Managed Spark with collaboration features\n- **Spark on EMR**: AWS managed clusters\n- **Spark on Kubernetes**: Cloud-native deployment\n\n## Common Use Cases\n\n1. **ETL at Scale**: Process terabytes of data\n2. **Data Lake Processing**: Transform raw lake data\n3. **Real-time Analytics**: Stream processing pipelines\n4. **Machine Learning**: Train models on big data\n5. **Log Analysis**: Process application and server logs",
