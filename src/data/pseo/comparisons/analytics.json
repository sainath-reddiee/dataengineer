    "intro": "### The OLAP Performance Kings\n\nWhen standard databases (Postgres, MySQL) can't handle your analytics queries anymore, you move to an **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** database. **ClickHouse** and **Apache Druid** are the two industry leaders for lightning-fast queries on billions of rows.\n\n**ClickHouse** (originated at Yandex) is a columnar database designed to be extremely fast on a single server or a cluster. It is famed for its query performance and hardware efficiency. It handles batch and streaming data with ease.\n\n**Apache Druid** was designed for a specific use case: real-time ingestion and ultra-high-concurrency queries (thousands of users at once). It uses a unique architecture that combines indexing, columnar storage, and pre-aggregation (rollups).",
