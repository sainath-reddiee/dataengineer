        "intro": "### The Heavyweights of Cloud Analytics\n\n**Amazon Redshift** was the first major player to make cloud data warehousing accessible. It is built on a modified PostgreSQL core and is deeply integrated into the AWS ecosystem (S3, IAM, Glue). \n\n**Snowflake** disrupted the market by being the first to truly separate storage and compute, allowing them to scale independently. Unlike Redshift, which was originally cluster-based, Snowflake was born as a multi-tenant SaaS service that requires virtually no performance tuning from the user.\n\nWith **Redshift Serverless**, AWS has bridged much of the gap, but the performance characteristics and management philosophies remain distinct.",
