        "intro": "### The Cloud Connector Wars\n\nIn the modern data stack, the 'E' and 'L' of ETL are often outsourced to managed services. **Fivetran** and **Stitch** (now part of Talend/Qlik) are the two biggest names in this space.\n\n**Fivetran** is famous for its \"Zero Configuration\" philosophy. They build every connector themselves, handle all schema changes automatically, and offer a very high SLA. They are the premium choice for teams that don't want to touch their ingestion pipelines.\n\n**Stitch** is built on the open-source **Singer** standard. It offers a more developer-centric experience and is generally more affordable for smaller teams. However, it requires a bit more hand-holding than Fivetran and the connector depth isn't as consistent.",
