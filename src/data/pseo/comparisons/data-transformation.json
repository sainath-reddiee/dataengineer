    "winner": "dbt",
    "shortVerdict": "dbt is the undisputed industry standard for analytics engineering. Dataform is a fantastic, free alternative specifically for BigQuery shops.",
    "intro": "### The SQL Framework Wars\n\nBefore **dbt (data build tool)**, data transformation was often a mess of stored procedures and unversioned SQL scripts. dbt changed the world by bringing software engineering best practices—version control, testing, documentation, and CI/CD—to SQL.\n\n**Dataform** was a direct competitor that offered similar functionality with a slightly different flavor (JavaScript for config instead of YAML). Google acquired Dataform in 2020 and has integrated it directly into BigQuery as a native, free service.\n\n### The Core Difference\n\nThe biggest differentiator is **portability**. dbt can run on Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks, Postgres, and more. Learning dbt is a transferable skill. Dataform is now effectively a Google Cloud product. It is optimized specifically for BigQuery and runs entirely within that ecosystem.",
