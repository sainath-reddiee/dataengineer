    "intro": "### The Data Movement Dilemma\n\nEvery data platform needs data moved into it. **Fivetran** pioneered the \"Managed ELT\" market. Their value prop is simple: You pay us, and we guarantee your Salesforce data lands in Snowflake every 15 minutes. No coding, no maintenance.\n\n**Airbyte** entered as the open-source disruptor. They correctly identified that Fivetran was too expensive for many, and that the \"Long Tail\" of connectors (custom APIs) wasn't being served. Airbyte provides a platform where *anyone* can build a connector.\n\n### The Trade-off\n\nFivetran is a black box. You trust them to handle schema drift and API changes. It is extremely reliable but costs a premium (based on Monthly Active Rows).\nAirbyte puts the power in your hands. You can self-host it for \"free\" (compute costs only), or use their Cloud. The connector quality varies (Gold vs. Alpha), but the flexibility is infinite.",

They are the premium choice for teams that don't want to touch their ingestion pipelines.\n\n**Stitch** is built on the open-source **Singer** standard.
